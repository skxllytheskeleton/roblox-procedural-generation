# Roblox Procedural Generation

This is a roblox script that allows for a bunch of rooms to be infinitely generated!

## How it works

Every room that is able to generate has a door that acts as an "exit" to the room. The next room doesn't generate until the door is opened, to temporarily save space.

Whenever a room is generated, the code will make sure that the room isn't the same as the room before it, so turn rooms are much less likely to generate a bunch of rooms that lead to the inside of an existing room.
